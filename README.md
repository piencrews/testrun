# RULES AND OTHER HOUSEKEEPING THINGS


Hello! This is Tapas! Welcome to the piencrews website gang! There is a couple of rules that I want to place down before
this turns into chaos.

RULES:

1. Please add your name at the beginning or end of a comment in the code. So we know who was on it and working on it.
2. Before you hit the "commit new file" or something like that PLEASE add a description of what you have done or changes
that has been made. ALSO add your name in the description, if we have more people join.
3. Feel free to leave your question on the code but make it to a comment. Someone or I will answer it. If you need help on a part in your code, you can add it and make sure you say you need help or you can PM one of us on LINE.
4. Make sure to check it before you change or add anything. 
5. Have fun and learn something!
